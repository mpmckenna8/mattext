This is a little text editor made from a tutorial to get people started with node-webkit. The tutorial is located at:

http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/introduction-to-html5-desktop-apps-with-node-webkit--net-36296

It kind of works but there's still a lot I could add t the menubars and general functionality.  I should especially look at the example editor and see if I can add any of their useful features.  

First off I gotta branch this off and try and make a usable editor.  I was thinking about trying to use me some level db to add some recent file functionality and other stuff.
